# Tennis App

In this project I have developed an app which allows users to look at, interact with and download data on ATP tour players & matches.

the TennisApp is set out as a dashboard with charts, tables and KPI tiles. The side bar allows users to filter the data on player, year, surface and tour level.

The dataset in the app has data from the start of the ATP tour in 1990 - there are some gaps from the earlier days. 

The app displays the last completed tournament within its database on top of the side bar.
